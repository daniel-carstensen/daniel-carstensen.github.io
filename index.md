    <p>Hello! I am a researcher at the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. Currently, I am working as a Lab Manager and Research Assistant at the <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/favila-lab/">Favila Lab</a> at Brown University, where I investigate how deep neural network embedding spaces align with Shepard's universal law of generalization.</p>
    
    <p>My research focuses on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Applying computational modeling, especially deep learning, to cognitive neuroscience</li>
      <li>Understanding episodic memory and category learning</li>
      <li>Examining how visual information processed in higher visual cortex regions supports memory</li>
      <li>Exploring how the hippocampus organizes perceptually similar experiences into categories</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I use frameworks such as Shepard's universal law of generalization as tools to better understand these cognitive phenomena. Ultimately, my goal is to bridge insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial neural networks to clarify how the brain supports complex cognition.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
