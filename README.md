# Personal Website for Daniel Carstensen

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://daniel-carstensen.github.io/](https://daniel-carstensen.github.io/). The site is built using Jekyll and is designed to showcase my work as a STEM researcher.

## Features

- **Home/Landing Page**: A brief bio and contact information.
- **Publications Page**: A list of my publications and conference posters/proceedings.
- **CV Page**: An embedded PDF of my CV.

## Customization

- **Content**: Edit the Markdown files (`index.md`, `publications.md`, `cv.md`) to add your personal information.
- **CV**: Place your CV PDF in the `assets` folder and update the link/embed code in `cv.md`.
- **Configuration**: Modify `_config.yml` for site-wide settings like title, description, and social media links.
- **Styling**: The site uses the default `minima` theme. You can override its styles or layouts by creating corresponding files in your repository (e.g., `_layouts/default.html`, `assets/main.scss`). Refer to the [Minima theme documentation](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) for details.
